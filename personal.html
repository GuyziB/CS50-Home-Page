        <h2>I'm here, "Just a regular GUY!"</h2>
        <p>Is that fair? Am I just a regular guy?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dad</li>
            <li>Husband</li>
            <li><a href="sports.html">Sports Enthusiast</a></li>
            <li>Generalist</li>
            <li>Gemini</li>
            <li><a href="#secrets">Secrets</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> I am an ENGINEER, but one with a passion for the ENTERTAINMENT industry. Can you get more Gemini in terms of that contradiction? I am Dad with all the love for my kids. BUT, I have always had my own, in many ways, selfish life. And I love the time away from them, and my wife. But I also spend plenty of time with them. I am, in actual fact, not good with folk that only live for their kids, or only live for their work.(Never give up your own passions, BTW.) Too many old people end up without interests, I don't think that'll happen to me. Look here, I am learning a little CS for my sins. Why? I have no idea. Where will it lead? I also have no idea. But it's fun. I love to learn stuff, but being a generalist, it's always quite surface knowledge. Oh, and I am also, not a huge fan of LAZY SUNDAYS. What a waste!</p>
        <h3>Quotes that shed some light on me...</h3>
        <ul class = "quotes">
            <li>"Work Hard, Play Hard." - Thanks Mum, she taught this to me early. And it stuck.</li>
            <li>“The man on top of the mountain didn't fall there.” ― Vince Lombardi.</li>
            <li>"Good is the enemy of great." - I first heard this from a friend called Mark. It's not an original, I know that. But he told me first.</li>
            <li>"Federer is the GOAT" - not a quote, just adding my voice to a debate that will range for ever. </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="secrets">Did you know: I love those behind the scenes interactions between sporting greats, or between sporting greats and the press. Not the sham shit that they show on sporting news. The stuff when they sitting down, or walking out the door. Or when somehow, they lose their cool and go "off script" as it were. Eddie Jones is a classic at this. If I find a link, I'll put it here.</p>
