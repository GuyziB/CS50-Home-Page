        <h1>Less of a GENERALIST</h1>
        <h2>Professional Life - "Have you ever seen a skinny chef?"</h2>

        <h3>01 / UNDERGRAD</h3>
        <p class="square_text">Univeristy in South Africa in the early 90s was heady stuff. "Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?" This was the vote to end Apartheid. A great time of immense change, and I was in the midst. </p>

        <p>I probably missed a trick in the transition from school to university. I ended up graduating with a B.Sc in Electronics. My time was the end of the analogue era. The Internet was approaching its tipping point and perhaps Computer Science would have been a better choice. Even better, B.Sc in Business Science ... I don't regret my path at all though. Engineering teaches you, primarily, to think like an engineer. Problems before solutions and all that. If you ever dancing around a fire (Metaphor - fire is a problem) look for the person with the fire extinguisher. That's the engineer. I only learnt that when I entered the real working world. Very few people actually stop to think.</p>

        <h3>02 / LONDON</h3>
        <p class="square_text">Good jobs; Good money; Good experience. That's what greeted the large number of South African graduates that made the journey to London in the mid 90s. i was no exception.</p>
        <p>I am still in contact with many people I met during those formative London years.</p>
        <p>I think that I chased the momey a little bit in those early years. I was (am) a network engineer just as the transition to Web 2.0 was gathering momentum. But in '95, I worked for IBM. The BIG BLUE. My first project was to remove dumb Wang Terminals from users and replace with a brand shiny new PC. By 2003 when the IT journey ended we were all talking Web 2.0. Data centers, Disaster recovery sites, cheap bandwidth, network incursions and security concerns. All of which was down my street and under my remit. After a while though it all felt a little formulaic. Copying of best practices, fitting in with budgets, managing consultants. There had to be more.<p>

        <h3>03 / MBA</h3>
        <p class="square_text">Back to South Africa, Cape Town this time. I think that MBA courses were invented for engineers looking for more, or to fill in gaps. I started our with a focus on moulding myself into an IT Director or CTO type. I developed an interest in macroeconomics and entreprenuship.</p>
        <p>The one thing that I missed during that period was the relization that you can build a business in the formal employment world. You don't have to be out there, on your own, to be entreprenurial.</p>
        <p>There were some crazy long days and nights at UCT, and at times the immersion was too much. But it was good preparation for the next phase in my professional career.</p>

        <h3>04 / NIGHTCLUBS & STRAIGHT UP BAR SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <p class = "square_text">And now we get to the "Engineer with a passion for the entertainment industry" part. Did you know that I owned nightclubs? Not little small ones either. Big ones, 3000 people sized nightclubs. <a href="https://claphamgrand.com/">The Clapham Grand</a>, was one. Award winning <a href="https://web.facebook.com/SirJamesvanderMerwe">Sir James van der Merwe</a> is another. <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/gold-standard-bars-2015#a3nwEpYL4bb">Conde Naste Best Bars 2015.</a> It was a while back. But I'm good at bars and parties.</p>
        <p>Hard work; Long days; Even longer nights. But it was all worth it. When you own a nightclub you do EVERYTHING yourself. Well, you and a little team. There is all the usual stuff of small business.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marketing, Promotions</li>
            <li>HR, Customer relations</li>
            <li>Ops, Project Management</li>
            <li>Finances, Budgeting</li>
            <li>Dealmaking</li>
            <li>Rent negotiation</li>
            <li>Manament accounting</li>
            <li>... the list goes on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But not many people in a corporate role have spoken to a journalist writing a negative piece. Not many have had a viral social media problem. How many have bought a business? The first time I tried to value an entertainment business i was interesed in I almost cried. My MBA skills were no where on that one. </p>
        <p>Crisis, I have made a lot of mistakes. Top Tip: Before you buy any business makes sure that you know EVERYTHING there is to know about it. I have just been tripped up with my latest purchase. I didn't look closely at staff costs because I though I knew, after years of experience, what they would be. I was wrong, the previous owners were overpaying and that has caused some serious problems in the COVID world.</p>
        <p>10 years, a wife, 2 kids and it was time for a change.</p>
        <p>I'd seen the outsoucring model work well during my time at IBM Global Services. I figured I could apply this to the hospitality game. And guess what, it worked. <a href="https://www.straightup.co.za">Straight Up Bar Solutions</a> was born. And here we are today.</p>

        <h3>05 / POST COVID</h3>
        <p class="square_text">CS50 and the post COVID era. One thing is fore sure hospitality will never be the same. Checkout my pivot into <a href="https://online.straightup.co.za">Online@Straight Up</a> which is a site for online liquor sales and supply.</p>
        <p>But I think that a final change in direction is called for. I am halfway through my working life now. With 25 years or so remaining. The next change is important. I love the entertainment and hospitality world and I am loving the rekindling of my techie CS50 / engineering interest. Is there a way to combine the two?</p>
